Dual RFM69W Transceiver PCB
---------------------------

Designed by Felix Baessler, felix.baessler@gmail.com

The project illustrates the problem that the costs for external protection and connection often exceed the prize you pay for internal electronic "ingrediants". 

### Features:
The HRD_S2.zip file contains all that is required to produce a PCB that fits into a standard SD card box <br/> 
of ca. 53x43x7 mm (see illustrations in images folder):
- &nbsp;**2 Hope rfm69w radio modules** placed on a common bus
- &nbsp;**1 Arduino compatible mini pro 3.3V (MEGA328P)** microcontroller <br/>
- **10 standard Dupont connectors** fixed in 0.8 mm slots <br/>
  for the attachmant of 2 antennas and a USB-Serial dongle

### Context
The described setup serves as a reference for the <br/>
[OOK Raw Data Receiver](https://github.com/ookraw/OOK-Raw-Data-Receiver)

### Special Requirement
The enclosed zip-file specifies ten 0.8 mm slots. Make sure that these slots will be edge plated : <br/>
on the top and on the buttom layer and also on the inner side of the slots, like a through hole.
