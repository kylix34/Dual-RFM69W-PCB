Dual RFM69W Transceiver PCB
---------------------------

Designed by Felix Baessler, felix.baessler@gmail.com

The project focuses on the minimization of the costs for connectors and enclosure which quite often even exceed the prize 
you pay for your electronic components. In our daily use, a standard SD card box (ca. 53x43x7 mm) and a couple of steel needles did the job.

### Features:
The HRD_S2.zip file contains all that is required to produce a PCB that fits into a SD card box : <br/> 

- &nbsp;**2 Hope rfm69w radio modules** placed on a common bus
- &nbsp;**1 Arduino compatible mini pro 3.3V (MEGA328P)** microcontroller <br/>
- **10 standard Dupont connectors** fixed in 0.8 mm slots <br/>
  for the attachmant of 2 antennas and a USB-Serial dongle

### Context
The described setup serves as a reference for the [OOK Raw Data Receiver](https://github.com/ookraw/OOK-Raw-Data-Receiver)

### Special Requirement
The enclosed zip-file specifies ten 0.8 mm slots. Make sure that these slots will be edge plated : <br/>
on the top and on the buttom layer and also on the inner side of the slots, like a through hole.
